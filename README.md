# QuizApp

It is a small project in which I have to implement many different features, which is a Quiz application I want to develop. 

 

1. Registration Page

• Before taking a quiz, a user has to first register and login. User can directly click on the register link (provided on either login page or nav bar) and be directed to a register page to create an account.

2. Login Page

• Login Page should be the default page when user enters the application.

• If the user is not login but attempts to access your quiz application, you should redirect them to Login Page as well.

 

3. Home Page

• List of different type quiz that the application provides

• You should at least have 3 different type of quizzes
